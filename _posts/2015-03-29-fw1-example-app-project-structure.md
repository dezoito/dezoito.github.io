title: FW/1 Example Application - Project Structure
---

This is the first in a series of articles on how to build a
[ColdFusion and FW/1 Example Application](https://dezoito.github.io/2015/03/26/fw1-example-app-released/).

I'll assume you are not new to CFML, so don't take this as a detailed guide or
tutorial, but more of a starting point (I'll be a little more detailed in the article on tests).

Here's the list of topics:

 - Project Structure
 - Forms and Validation Patterns
 - Use of User Defined Function Libraries
 - Accessing an External Service
 - BDD and Integration Tests.

 ###FW/1 Project Structure

```
{% highlight js %}
// Example code using highlight
x = 0;

{% endhighlight %}
```
