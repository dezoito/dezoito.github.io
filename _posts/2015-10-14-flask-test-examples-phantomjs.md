title: Flask: Test Examples and Structure - Unit Tests and PhantomJS
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

This article is similar to the [Ready to use Structure for Django Tests](/2015/09/21/how-to-test-django-applications_pt1/) and the main goals are:

 - get your tests up and running quickly
 - provide a starting point for more complex tests

We'll use my [Flask App to generate summaries](https://github.com/dezoito/flask_Summarizer/) as the test target (feel free to clone it).
